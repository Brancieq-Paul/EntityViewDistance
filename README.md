# Entity View Distance
This mod allows you to modify distance in which entities become visible!
It works on client and server, while not being required on either (aka vanilla clients/servers can still connect).
Ideal if you want to limit rendering distance of item frames, armor stands, and any other (including modded) entities.

You can modify options in `Entity Distance Settings` in `Video Settings` or through `/entityviewdistance` command.

*This mod works only on Fabric Mod Loader with Fabric API or compatible!*
